# 📌 System Design — Introduction

## 🧠 What is System Design?
System design is the structured process of **defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, interactions, and overall structure** of a software system so that it meets **functional and non-functional requirements**. It acts as a **blueprint** that guides implementation and evolution of software systems.

- Translates high-level requirements into concrete architectures.
- Focuses on big-picture engineering, not just writing code.
- Ensures scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

---

## 🧩 System Design vs Software Design

### System Design
- Focuses on overall architecture and system components.
- Handles scalability, fault tolerance, and distributed systems.

### Software Design
- Focuses on internal structure of software.
- Deals with classes, modules, and code-level patterns.

> System design operates at a **higher level of abstraction** than software design.

---

## 🔍 Why System Design Matters
- Enables systems to **scale** efficiently.
- Helps build **reliable and fault-tolerant** systems.
- Improves **performance and resource utilization**.
- Prevents costly architectural mistakes later.
- Supports evolving business and technical requirements.

# 🛠️ How To Approach System Design

## 1) Understand the Problem
- Gather functional and non-functional requirements.
- Identify users and their needs.
- Clarify constraints (latency, security, cost, compliance).

## 2) Identify the Scope
- Define what is **in-scope** and **out-of-scope**.
- Establish system boundaries.
- Prevent uncontrolled requirement expansion.

# 📘 System Design — Core Concepts & Patterns
#systemdesign #architecture #distributed-systems

Here are several important concepts that play a role in modern system design.

---

## 🔹 Horizontal and Vertical Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
- Adds **more nodes/servers** to distribute system load.
- Improves:
  - Performance
  - Reliability
  - Availability
- Common in **cloud environments**.
- Achieved via:
  - Load balancing
  - Sharding (data split across instances)

✅ Handles more requests simultaneously.

---

### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
- Adds more resources to a **single server**:
  - CPU
  - Memory
  - Storage
- Achieved by:
  - Hardware upgrade
  - Increasing VM resources

⚠ Limitations:
- Hardware constraints
- Possible downtime
- Scaling limit exists

---

## 🔹 Redundancy and Replication

### Redundancy
- Duplication of:
  - System components
  - Data
- Improves reliability and fault tolerance.

### Replication
- Multiple data copies across nodes.
- Ensures:
  - Availability
  - Fault tolerance
  - Data durability

---

## 🔹 Microservices Architecture

Architecture where an application is split into:

- Small
- Independent
- Loosely coupled services

Each service:
- Handles specific functionality
- Communicates via APIs
- Can be deployed and scaled independently

Benefits:
- Modularity
- Scalability
- Easier maintenance

---

## 🔹 CAP Theorem

A distributed system can guarantee **only two** of:

1. **Consistency**
2. **Availability**
3. **Partition Tolerance**

### Definitions
- **Consistency** → All nodes see same data.
- **Availability** → Every request receives response.
- **Partition Tolerance** → System works despite network failures.

Trade-offs must be chosen.

---

## 🔹 Proxy Servers

A proxy acts as an **intermediary** between client and server.

Uses:
- Load balancing
- Security
- Caching
- Traffic filtering

Benefits:
- Improved performance
- Backend protection
- Traffic distribution

---

## 🔹 Message Queues

Used for **asynchronous communication**.

Characteristics:
- Decouples components
- Stores & forwards messages
- Enables independent scaling

Benefits:
- Reliability
- Fault tolerance
- Scalability

Examples: Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS.

---

## 🔹 File Systems

Manages storage and organization of files.

Functions:
- File & directory management
- Access control
- Data integrity

Types:
- Local file systems
- Distributed file systems

Trade-offs:
- Performance
- Scalability
- Fault tolerance

---

# 🏗 System Design Architecture & Patterns

---

## 🔹 Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

Distributed transaction protocol ensuring atomicity.

### Phases
1. **Prepare Phase**
   - Participants vote commit/abort.
2. **Commit Phase**
   - Coordinator decides outcome.

Guarantee:
- Either all commit or none.

⚠ Slow and blocking under failures.

---

## 🔹 Replicated Load-Balanced Services (RLBS)

Multiple service instances behind load balancer.

Benefits:
- Higher availability
- Better performance
- Fault tolerance

Mechanisms:
- Replication
- Load balancing

---

## 🔹 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separates:
- **Commands** → Modify data
- **Queries** → Read data

Advantages:
- Independent scaling
- Performance optimization
- Flexible data models

---

## 🔹 Saga Pattern

Manages long-running distributed transactions.

Instead of global transaction:
- Uses sequence of **local transactions**.
- Each has a **compensating action**.

If failure occurs:
- Actions rollback in reverse order.

### Example: E-Commerce Saga

Services:
1. Order Service → create/cancel order
2. Inventory Service → reserve/release stock
3. Payment Service → charge/refund

Ensures consistency without distributed locks.

---

## 🔹 Sharded Services

Data split across multiple shards.

Each shard:
- Stores subset of data
- Operates independently

Benefits:
- Better scalability
- Higher throughput

Challenges:
- Complex querying
- Data consistency
