# 📌 System Design — Introduction

## 🧠 What is System Design?
System design is the structured process of **defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, interactions, and overall structure** of a software system so that it meets **functional and non-functional requirements**. It acts as a **blueprint** that guides implementation and evolution of software systems.

- Translates high-level requirements into concrete architectures.
- Focuses on big-picture engineering, not just writing code.
- Ensures scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## 🧩 System Design vs Software Design

### System Design
- Focuses on overall architecture and system components.
- Handles scalability, fault tolerance, and distributed systems.

### Software Design
- Focuses on internal structure of software.
- Deals with classes, modules, and code-level patterns.

> System design operates at a **higher level of abstraction** than software design.

## 🔍 Why System Design Matters
- Enables systems to **scale** efficiently.
- Helps build **reliable and fault-tolerant** systems.
- Improves **performance and resource utilization**.
- Prevents costly architectural mistakes later.
- Supports evolving business and technical requirements.

# 🛠️ How To Approach System Design

## 1) Understand the Problem
- Gather functional and non-functional requirements.
- Identify users and their needs.
- Clarify constraints (latency, security, cost, compliance).

## 2) Identify the Scope
- Define what is **in-scope** and **out-of-scope**.
- Establish system boundaries.
- Prevent uncontrolled requirement expansion.

[[Scope Definition]]

---

## 3) Research and Analyze Existing Systems
- Study similar systems and reference architectures.
- Learn from past successes and failures.
- Use findings to guide design trade-offs.

## 4) Create a High-Level Design
- Identify major components and interactions.
- Define data flows and communication paths.
- Draft architecture diagrams.

## 5) Refine the Design
- Define APIs and data models.
- Plan scalability and failure handling.
- Address security and performance concerns.
- Iterate based on feedback.

## 6) Document the Design
- Record architecture decisions.
- Add diagrams and assumptions.
- Maintain clear and accessible documentation.

[[Architecture Decision Records]]

---

## 7) Monitor and Improve Continuously
- Collect system metrics (latency, throughput, errors).
- Identify bottlenecks.
- Improve design as requirements evolve.
